        On my eighth birthday I decided to do something different. Instead of receiving gifts on my special day, I decided to give away gifts. I wanted to be Santa Claus! I wanted to help poor people in some way. I shared the idea with my parents. They too were
        quite excited. So, we decided to donate goody bags to slum dwellers. They agreed with my plan and helped me with all the arrangements. We bought many food items like biscuits, cakes, bananas, chocolates, and some soft drinks, toys, clothes and
        about fifty white polythene bags. These things were kept in the boot of my car as we drove down to the slum. We were having a lot of fun listening to and singing songs. We also played many oral games. I saw a row of slums – temporary houses covered
        with blue tarpaulin. I was surprised at the cleanliness of the place. This place had many more people than we had expected. As soon as we parked the car and took out one bag to pack, these kids called all their friends. They ran excitedly to the
        car almost bumping their heads on the window. While we were arranging the items in the bags, the kids were getting restless as everyone wanted to get to the goody bag first. They put both their palms on the window with their smiling eager face
        in between. While looking at their faces I thought about the differences between us. I was forced to reflect on our living premises and theirs. Three of us – my parents and I, we have a car and a comfortable house where we get a huge bed to sleep
        in and get good sleep. These people have a house which is half the size of my room and there are more than six people who live in one house. At this poignant moment I was forced to think of all the luxuries that I have in my life. Haven’t I taken
        all these for granted? Excess of things like food, clothes, games etc while these children were yearning for the goody bags. I realized that they relied on items which a few generous people like us would come along and give them on a day to day
        basis. In my heart, I thanked my parents for my basic needs. Suddenly, I heard a loud BANG! A few kids were banging the side door of the car. I had to go out and request them to stop banging the door. As soon as I went out, they got scared and
        stepped back. At this point of time I felt really bad. Most of the kids who were standing outside the car behaved as if they did not get enough things and enough food. It showed their desperation for food and new things. I felt one had to depend
        on others for everything in life. I wondered how these little children could live in such small places which they call their home. I wondered why I still often fought with my parents for a separate media room. I wondered why my cupboards were
        overflowing with the best of clothes whereas these children were happy to be running around in tattered clothes. Soon, we got out of the car and started handing over the goody bags. Their teeth flashed in big smiles. Their pale faces lit up with
        glee. I was overwhelmed with joy – the joy of sharing. The nursery song flash in my mind. “Sharing and sharing all the good things we have, what better way is there to live together than sharing all we have…” After that we asked them if we could
        visit their slum. They took us around and explained each and everything. They told us that the kids help both their parents who worked in the construction site. They filled and carried water in the pots from the nearby corporation tap. The children
        play on the road where vehicles pass by every other minute. They kept migrating from one place to another wherever work was available. Suddenly, it hit me that the people who constructed my own house do not have a proper permanent house of their
        own to live in. They lived in such small unsafe places! I was shocked to discover that the children never went to school. My parents told me that they were uneducated. I go to a hundred - acre school which is one of the best in India. A big bus
        comes to pick me up in morning. However, I am so glad to go to a school where they give you experiences of real - life situations. We spent some more time playing games with them. They taught us many different games. The next two hours felt like
        two minutes. I also played kabaddi with them. They played like professionals. I did not expect them to play so well. They were really quick and had a lot of stamina. It was a tough and close game. We played on soft sand so that we would not get
        hurt. They played a little easy on me as they thought I was new to the game. This showed their concern for people. They wanted to enjoy the game as well as try and win. The game helped me think about the class difference. While a simple physical
        game like kabaddi gives so much pleasure, a day – long game of cricket with such expensive equipment could get boring. People in the upper middle or higher class including me think that the poor cannot do anything and are not good at anything.
        It made me realize how the social status does not define how good you are at something. Everybody is good at something or the other. This was one of the biggest takeaways from the game. To our surprise they offered us lunch. There was one small
        banana, roti, some aloo, and water. The lunch was one of the best I have ever had in my life. I felt really greedy as I thought I was consuming their only food. Soon it was time for us to go. They wanted to play with me for a longer time but I
        had a party planned at home. They came till our car to see us off. I felt a little sad leaving my new friends behind. I realized how much happiness there is in interacting with these people. Happiness knows no bounds of disparity. Half an hour
        after I reached home, my friends came over to have a party. While we had a lot of fun, I narrated how I had made new friends a few hours earlier. They were quite excited and promised to do the same on their birthday as well. Pizzas, pastas and
        burgers were the party snacks that we had. These expensive wasteful snacks seemed an unnecessary waste of money, while buying good, healthy food could have saved many people from starvation. That was the last birthday party I have ever had! Every
        other month my parents and I donate a lot of things to the needy and the poor. According to me, donations have to be made every day – not only on special days. You will feel as good as the people receiving them. Their happiness is the best return
        gift one can have. We also have to understand that poor people need our help and their life depends on us. This means that what ever we give them, it is for their day – to – day life. It makes a difference to their lives. By donating we do not
        lose anything and people who are getting things gain a lot out of it. The excess that we have should be set aside for people who need it more than us. Large organizations should take it up as a social responsibility. The governments should provide
        the basic necessities to all the people of our country. I realized that “Every drop makes an ocean”…
