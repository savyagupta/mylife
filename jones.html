    <h1><u>Mr. Jones' Murder Case</u></h1><br>

    <p style=" text-align: center; width: 100%; overflow: hidden;">Mr. Jones, an investment banker, goes for a six o’ clock morning walk every day without fail. Today, it was different! I could not see him. The dark menacing clouds peered over the valleys. It was a gloomy morning with deserted streets and mist in
        the hazy air. I decided to go to his house and figure out what happened. “Screech!” The door opened reluctantly. I entered the house and headed straight for Mr. Jones’ room. He never locked his door. “Whoa! To my horror, he was still lying down
        on his bed and was not breathing. My eyes widened and I was speechless. It was an appalling murder. It In no time I dialled 911. “Hello, there has been a murder in the Saint Teresa Colony house number 42. Please come and check fast” “Sure sir.
        We are sending two units to the address. We will be there in ten minutes” My parents and the neighbors were soon apprised of the incident. My friends and I started discussing about this incident as we all loved Mr. Jones and were shocked at the
        news of his demise. He had helped us a lot initially when we just shifted here for our internship. “He was an old man. I am sure he died due to some disease” “He had bad hygiene. Must have died because of this” “Hello father. Mr. Jones, my neighbor
        was murdered last night in his sleep”, I called my father. “Son he used to drink a lot. His death would be because of this. I don’t think he would have been murdered”, my father replied and cut the phone. I knew from the moment the New York police
        arrived that they would not believe the truth. My parents and everyone else claimed that Mr. Jones, an investment banker died of natural causes, even though some of the facts according to me pointed towards the obvious truth – he was murdered
        in his sleep… I was sure if I could somehow figure out these facts, the police and everyone else would be convinced that it was a murder. The police believing it to be a murder was as likely as finding Osama Bin Laden dining in the White House.
        Today, it was a balmy day as the citizens of New York bathed in its benevolent warmth. The sun seemed to be smiling at us. Mysteriously Mr. Jones’ bedroom window was closed. He liked fresh air and it was only in the peak bleak winters where the
        chill bitter wind forced him to close his windows. “Could this be one of the leads?”, I thought. It was up to my friends and I to solve this murder as we knew the police would not be able to figure out the clues on their own. After a lot of search,
        they went at around nine o’ clock in the morning leaving a notice in front of the main door. It said: “There has been a murder here. The search is going on. Please don’t enter this area”. The police did not Cordon off the area as they didn’t want
        to drag attention of other passersby and other residents who lived slightly far off. The search eventually ended as the police thought it was a natural death. Abhimanyu, a tall stout lad with a melancholic nature, Rohan, a gaunt man who is slightly
        sullen and I, a plump boy with winsome eyes began to plan how we could track down our man. “I think we should split up and ask people regarding……” “We should check out Mr. Jones’ house once the police….” “No, I feel we should first ask people”
        The room was filled with heated discussions. After a lot of deliberation, we divided the work. Ding Dong! “We have to ask you a few questions” Abhimanyu and Rohan were doing the interrogation while I decided to go to Mr. Jones’ house and look
        for clues which could help the police recognize the reality. At around ten o’ clock in the morning the house was quiet. Some leaves of various maple trees were rustling in the gushy wind which made sad, eerie noise. Nothing mattered to me at the
        moment as I set out to the house for the second time which was a block away. “Screech!” The door made a loud noise. I was amazed on going inside when I saw four rooms attached to each other. Living in a one room house, this sight was ivory. As
        I entered Mr. Jones’ room, I saw him lying dead on his bed and his gold chain was missing. The shining and glittering gold chain could be seen through his window from outside. He used to keep it on all the time. When he wanted to sleep, he removed
        it and kept it on his side table. The police had also not found the chain during their search. “Could this be one of the proofs”, I thought. On going closer to his bed, I saw a yellowish red plant kept under his side table. It looked as if someone
        had hidden it. The plant looked new and I knew by the character of Mr. Jones that he disliked plants. “Could this plant have been used to murder him…?” Under the pot of the plant, there was a sticker in which the address of the shop was written.
        I came rushing back and showed my friends the plant and explained its history. They were shocked. We sat in our car and drove to the shop. “Can you please tell us the name and address of the person who bought this plan?” “Also please tell us when
        he bought it” “Let me check!”, replied the shopkeeper. “His name is Heron; he bought the plant twice. The first one, three days back and the other one yesterday morning at nine” “He showed me his card He was a bio lab technician. This plant is
        dangerous - once touched, it releases a highly poisonous gas for an hour and then acts like a normal plant. It may cause death if inhaled. It is used to conduct many experiments. The plant has a very limited sale as it is available to only highly
        certified bio – chemical technicians and……” As the shopkeeper was apprising us about the plant, I was thinking about all possible connections or relations which Jones would have had with Heron. “Why would Heron want to kill someone like Jones?”
        “Was Heron Jones’ friend? Did he gift this plant to him last week on his seventieth birthday?” “Umm, excuse me sir, any idea where Heron’s lab is?” “Yes, it’s in the down town near Heming’s Way restaurant” “Thanks” We rushed towards the address.
        “Excuse me, can you tell me where Heron’s lab is?” “It’s down the road to the right” “Thanks” We ran! To our horror, the door was locked. We peeped through the windows. “See there is a dead cockroach there in the corner”, exclaimed Abhimanyu.
        “Whoa! That is the same plant which we had found in the house”, Rohan screamed. “Oh yeah!”, I replied staring at the plant. “Now it was clear that Heron, a Bio – Chemical technician was hired by someone to buy this plant. Heron bought one plant
        three days back to check whether it really releases the gas or not. He tried it on a cockroach. The cockroach had died. He then went yesterday to buy the same plant and put in under Jones’ side table. Mr. Jones’ accidently might have touched it
        with his leg and the poisonous gas would have been released”, I thought. “Got it!”, I said. I told them the whole possibility which I just thought of. They were shocked and agreed with me. We drove back to the shop. “Can you please show us the
        C.C.T.V footage of Heron?” He was a heavy built, muscular man with broad chest. He looked innocent but scared. “Can you give us this video tape?” “Why do you want it?” “Listen, there has been a murder. We have to show this to the police. The police
        can catch Heron and interrogate him which can help us finally catch the murderer” “W – w- what! There has been a murder? Where?”, the shop keeper asked fearfully. “In our colony. You don’t need to worry. If u give us the footage, we will inform
        the police and they will catch the murderer” “Oh okay! Here, take the footage” When we reached home, we put the pen drive in the laptop and closely watched Heron’s face. We wanted to try and figure it out first before we approached the police.
        We explained the entire theory of the plant, the lab and Heron to the police. They had to believe us as it was their only evidence. After a lot of thought, the senior police commissioner, a hefty prudent man with a demoralizing nature said, “We
        appreciate your efforts but the case has been closed” “We understand sir but this proof is enough to know that Mr. Jones had been murdered and he didn’t die of natural causes. If you find Heron and interrogate him, we can figure out the real man
        behind all this and catch him” “Huh! Okay then. I will try sending three units for this search. Till then, I want you all to keep this to yourself. I don’t want any rumors spreading” “Sure sir. Thank you. We appreciate it” We reached home and
        had amazing cookies which we had ordered form Cookie Man last week. “These cookies are really good man”, Rohan said as he enjoyed every bit of the last cookie. We went back to the police station and saw a person like Heron getting interrogated.
        He was looking really tensed. I kept on twitching my fingers as I really wanted to know about the person who made him do this. Some of the police officers and we were working together on this case as it had already been closed and we didn’t have
        the support of other officers. “Heron said that he was blackmailed by a caller to do this job. If he didn’t do it, then the person on the call threatened him that he will do harm to him”, summarized a police officer. “Does Heron know anything
        about the person who called him?” “No! he said that it was an abrupt call” “Do you have the number? Can you track it ?” “We can try to figure out the location but not the exact person. The number is switched off. We are trying our best to find
        the person. If there are any more updates, we will let you know. This is Mr. Jones’ phone. Since you know Mr. Jones well, can you go through the contacts and see who he possibly could have had bad relations with?” I went through them one at a
        time. He never mentioned James. Whenever Mr. Jones spoke to me, he mentioned all his friend’s names but the name of James had never come up. “He could be the milk man? Or some delivery boy?”, I thought. However, I went through Jones’ WhatsApp
        messages with James. He had been chatting with him only since last two days. “I need the money by tomorrow or I will kill you”, was one message. “You will have to pay the price for what your son has done”, read another message. “What might have
        his son done? Had his son been voracious for something? Why was James so malevolent against him?” Rohan and Abhimanyu were shocked at these messages. It became evident that James was one of the main suspects for this murder. The police were convinced
        that a person called James lived in the area they tracked by the number Heron gave us. They went door to door investigating. No one had any clue of James. “New York Police! Ma’am we are investigating a murder and we need you to tell us if you
        know anything about James. Have you seen him? Has there been anything suspicious in the surrounding areas over the last few days?” “No sir. We don’t know anything about this. We have been out for the last few days. I think you should ask Mr. Frank,
        a good friend of ours. He has been in his house since a week and will surely know about this. He will be of great help. “New York Police! Sir we are investigating a murder and we need you to tell us if you know anything about James. Has there
        been anything wrong in the surrounding areas over the last few days?” “Two days back we saw a van come at eight o’ clock. Two men had got down and went behind the van and after ten minutes they had left”, said one family who lived close by to
        Mr. Jones’ house. “Thank you, sir! Do u know how the people in the van look?” “I haven’t seen them closely so I won’t be able to describe them sir” “Alright! Thank you” We all were confused about whether the person in the van was James or not.
        I opened my link den account and went through my messages with Mr. Jones. He never mentioned anything about James. “Hey guys I was going through my Facebook account and I searched for James. There are so many results showing for James”, told them.
        “Oh no! Now how do we find out the correct James?” we can’t arrest all the James’.” “Wait! Remember the officer said that they can get the location of the area from where the call came from. Try finding out which is the correct James by looking
        area wise” “Great!” “Oh! There are two James who live in the same area. Now how do we know who is the right one?”, I said curiously. “Doesn’t matter. We can arrest both James and interrogate them. Through the interrogation, we can find out the
        real one” “Right!” “Sir we just went through all the James’ profiles on Facebook and checked area wise. On that basis, we found two people called James living in that area. We would like you to arrest them and interrogate both of them. On that
        basis we could find the real one” “Are you sure about these people?” “Hundred percent sir” “Okay then. Peter, you have to find these people as soon as possible. Fill me up with all the updates as and when you get them” “Sure sir” “Mr. Jones was
        such an honorable and noble man”, Rohan said with tears in his eyes as we stepped on the gray stony pavement “He helped us get everything set in this primitive house when we arrived from India for our internship. He was really kindhearted and
        helpful”, Abhimanyu said with a hesitant tone. “Yeah! I loved his ……., before I could complete the phone rang. “Hello sir” “Hello Roshan. We could find only one person. The other seems to have left this area five days ago” “Oh okay. Is he being
        interrogated?” “Yes, he is in the room right now” “Okay thanks a lot” “Guys one of them is caught” “Let’s go” James sat back in his chair drumming the table. He looked as casual as Hippies. “So, Mr. James you would be aware of Jones’ murder?”
        “Can you stop asking me such questions? I told you a hundred times I don’t know who James is. Oh my god!” It looked as if he had a cantankerous nature because of his reactions to certain questions and as time passed, his irritability grew. I had
        a very strong inner feeling that he was the one who had planned Mr. Jones’ murder. We all kept moving up and down the lobby waiting for the interrogation to get over. “These people are crazy. I didn’t do anything”, muttered James to himself. “James!”,
        I called him. He turned around showing his big broad grin. “Why did you do that?” “Do what?” “Why did you murder Jones?”, I asked showing my anger. “I – I didn’t murder him”, he muttered. “Yeah right” He was put under arrest until we found the
        real murderer or got further clues that he was not the actual murderer. “What should we do now?”, Abhimanyu asked somberly. “I don’t know. I guess we try to find the real James” “Yeah I think that is our only option. But how?” “That’s what….”,
        Roshan was interrupted by Heron, “I can recognize his voice” “How will we hear his….” “Sir there has been a robbery in my neighbor’s house ten minutes ago”, interrupted a lady who ran into the police station. “Where has the robbery taken place?”
        “Saint Teresa Colony house number 39. It is still taking place. There is nobody in the house. If we go fast, we can stop them sir. I was too scared to try and stop them” “Sure Ma’am. We will go right away.” “Peter, send three units to Saint Teresa
        Colony house number 39 right away” “Dude I don’t know what is going on. First there was a murder and now a robbery”, Roshan was bewildered. “I agree. It’s very complicated. It will be more so if the robber and the murderer are the same person”
        “Yeah I mean a murder and a robbery in the same area in two consecutive days is very strange” Just then the police units arrived. “Sir the door is unlocked, the windows are open, the locker is open and there is no one inside. It’s Mr. Wigan, the
        multi – millionaire’s house sir” “What, the robbers ran away?”, the commissioner was shocked. He turned to the lady, “can you describe him? We can then make a sketch and track him down” “Yes Sir” “Okay. Peter call the sketch artist” “Okay Sir”
        “Sir, his name is Brent. He is the sketch artist” “Explain everything you saw to him. He will try and make the picture accordingly and with that we can track down our man”, the commissioner told the lady. “Ma’am try and describe every detail you
        saw”, Mr. Brent asked the lady. “Sure! He had narrow eyes. I could not see the color of the eyes. He had an oval face, a pointed noise and black moustache. He had a beard. He looked like he was in his twenties” “What color was his hair?” “He was
        bald” “Thank You ma’am” “Sir this is what he looks like according to what ma’am saw and said”, Brent told the commissioner after he was done with the picture” “Thank You Brent and thank you ma’am” “Peter take over a hundred print outs of this
        picture and send it everywhere. The robber should not exit the city at any cost. Stop all the exits of the city. All Airports, stations and ports should be sealed. Tell all the check points to stop all bald young men in their twenties. Show them
        the picture. I think he is determined to do more robberies in that area as it is a prime area. It is very unlikely that he will try to leave the city. But why to take a chance” “Okay Sir” “Roshan, we will find this robber and see if he has got
        anything to do with Jones’ murder also. You also mentioned that a really expensive gold chain was missing. So I have a strong feeling that he is linked with both the cases” “Yes Sir. I agree with you. Please let us know if he has any link” “Of
        course, Roshan” “Guys lets go back home and wait for that robber to get caught” “Come” “What a day man”, I reflected as we walked homeward – bound. The sun was a drop of burning gold. As soon as we reached home one of the neighbors asked,” Guys
        you have been roaming a lot today. You have been coming home and going back frequently today. What’s the matter?” “Nothing ma’am. We just visited a few friends and had some work outside”, Roshan lied to the neighbor. “Oh okay. I was just wondering
        why Mr. Jones didn’t go for a walk in the morning. He didn’t come out of his house also. His phone is switched off” “Y – y – yeah! He might be busy at home. Its fine” “Hmm! Okay then. Bye guys” “Bye” “Tring Tring!”, the phone rang. “Hello” “Hello
        Jignesh”, the commissioner used my name for the first time. “Hello Sir. Did we find the robber? Was he related to Jones’ death?” “Yes. We had found five suspects. One of them confessed to the robbery. When we asked him about the murder, he was
        blank and had no clue of it. It’s confusing” “Sir, can we come and try and figure out something?” “Sure” We set out again towards the police station after dinner. The moonlight led us through the ominous, empty streets. Suddenly our car stopped.
        The fuel was over. Through the back-view mirror, I saw a person walk straight into the house next to Mr. Jones’. Shocked, we all ran back towards the house. To our horror, we saw the security guard holding a knife and coming out of the house.
        When we approached him, he was stunned. Perhaps he didn’t expect to see us at such odd time. He was a very loyal, kindhearted and bold young man. “What are you doing here with a knife?”, asked Rohan boldly. “I – I thought I heard some unusual
        noise in the house so I wanted to check whether everything was fine. I rang the bell several times but there was no answer. Its eight o’ clock and Mr. Sac could not have possibly slept by now. So, I decided to break open the door and see if everything
        was okay”, replied the shivering security. “Oh okay. Is everything fine?” “Yeah no trouble as of now. Mr. Sac got scared when he saw me break the door and enter with a knife. Now he is fine” “Hmm. Should we go and check once? We can also meet
        him” “No!”, the security shouted fearfully, “He is fine. He said he doesn’t want to meet anyone till morning as he is busy with his work and wants to sleep early” “Oh okay. Cool then. Goodbye” “The security was slightly shivering. He didn’t want
        us to enter the house. There might be something wrong. Mr. Sac always likes to meet people. Maybe he actually has work and he doesn’t want to meet anyone” “Hey guys I feel something is wrong the way the security spoke to us. Should we go and check
        once?”, Roshan asked us. “I was just thinking about that. Sure, let’s go then. Even I feel that there is something wrong”, I replied. “Guys are you sure about this? The security warned us not to go. What is Mr. Sac gets really upset and our relations
        get worse. Should we really go?” “I think he is right. So, what should we do?”, Rohan asked. “Hmm. I think we should not go”, Abhimanyu convincingly said. “Okay. Let’s go back in that case”, Rohan agreed with Abhimanyu. Lying on my silky white
        bed, I could not sleep for the first twenty minutes. I finally decided to go and take a look in Mr. Sac’s house. The security guard had broken the lock so the door would be open. “Should I wake Rohan and Abhimanyu up?” After a lot of thought I
        decided to not wake them up. I took my flash light whose batteries were running down. “Where are you going at this hour Jignesh?”, the security came running behind me. It was eleven o’ clock and I had no excuse to give. “I was um. I was just going
        for a walk” “Oh, I see. Well then I would like to accompany you” “Oh sure” We walked and walked. The conversation became deeper and deeper. I was really sleepy and yet determined to go and check Mr. Sac’s house once. My torch lights went out.
        After I yawned a couple of times, the security guard said, “Looks like you have to get some sleep” “Y – yeah I guess”, I replied yawning again. I didn’t want to go back without checking. I felt that the security was preventing me from going to
        Sac’s house. He knew I was going there because of the direction in which I was walking. At the end of the road was Sac’s house “Okay then. Bye goodnight” “Goodnight” I ran back towards my house. The security was still staring at me. He waited
        for me to enter my house. I was hundred percent sure now that that there was something wrong. “Rohan wake up” “What happened?” I decided to go to Mr. Sac’s house and see what was wrong. The security met me outside and didn’t allow me to go. He
        engaged me in a conversation. In the end he said that I should go home. I had no option. So, I came back. I am quite certain that the security is hiding something and it is related to Mr. Sac. “Abhimanyu wake up”, Rohan and I woke him up. We apprised
        him of the incident. “Let’s go”, he said. “Okay but wait guys. We need to hide and go. We can’t let the security see us. He will get suspicious and something wrong might happen. Roshan, you go from the back and see whether everything is fine or
        not. Take Abhimanyu with you. I will wait here” “Okay” “I will go and distract the security. In the meantime, Rohan and Abhimanyu can go and see Mr. Sac’s house”, I thought. “Jignesh, there is no one here. I think there is a way where no one can
        see us”, Roshan came and told me. “Okay you both go. I will distract the security. I will give you ten minutes. After which I will come back home”, I said. “Done. Bye. Take care”, replied Rohan. “Bye” Rohan and Abhimanyu waited for me to get closer
        to the security. As I approached the security, they both started and the security came rushing towards me. “What happened Jignesh? You don’t look well” “Yeah! I just wanted to take a stroll again. The weather is really nice so I wanted to come
        out and experience it” “Oh okay”, Some tension was clearly visible on the security’s face. “Wait Roshan. Let’s go slowly. I think we should only go till the hall and peep from there instead of going inside the rooms. He wouldn’t like it” “Okay
        Abhimanyu. I think you are right” “Let’s go then” As we entered, we heard water dripping from a tap. “I think something is really wrong and we should call the cops instead of risking our lives. I thought of coming because I didn’t think of such
        a thing. I thought it’s just a simple thing like Mr. Sac is not well or something”, Abhimanyu slowly starting shivering with fear. “Okay you wait here if that’s the case. I will quickly go and take a look” “No. If you are going then I will accompany
        you” “Okay. Let’s go then” Roshan and Abhimanyu slowly crept inside. They saw the ornate decorations and the luxurious dining table. “What! L – l - look, there is blood here”, Abhimanyu said looking down. He almost fell down in shock. “What! Really?
        How?”, replied Rohan shocked. “I don’t know” “Wait. Look there”, Roshan pointed straight into Mr. Sac’s room where Sac was lying down on his bed bleeding profusely. “Oh no. I think he is dead” “Yeah. It’s a gruesome murder. How though? Who would
        have stabbed him three times in the stomach and once behind the neck?” “I don’t know” “Maybe the security killed him with that knife he had. Even Jignesh said that he had a strong feeling that there is something wrong with the security. Oh look!
        There is a yellow handkerchief right next to him on the floor there” “Oh yeah. I think the person who murdered him must have left it here by mistake. It has an ‘M’ printed on it. It can’t possibly be Mr. Sac’s handkerchief. Maybe the murderer’s
        name starts from ‘M’”, guessed Abhimanyu after going closer to the handkerchief. “That might be true. So, I guess we take the handkerchief as some evidence and get out of here” “Yeah that’s probably the best option we have as of now. There are
        two minutes left for us to get back. If we don’t, then the security will see us and we will get caught” “Okay” I looked at my watch after another long conversation. Ten minutes were up. It was quite an interesting conversation. I didn’t know how
        to break it. I finally said, “Okay. Looks like I really have to sleep now. Good bye and good night” “Alright, good night” I literally flew back home. “What happened guys? Is everything fine?” “Oh, thank god you are here Jignesh. Mr. Sac has been
        murdered”, Roshan said sadly. “What? How?” “I – I don’t know. But we found this yellow handkerchief. We assume it might be the murderer’s handkerchief” “Oh nice. That can give us some evidence. Tomorrow morning, we should apprise the commissioner
        about this”, I suggested. “Yeah” “Okay guys. Let’s sleep now. It’s already one o’ clock. We should leave for the police station by eight tomorrow”, suggested Abhimanyu. The morning rays of the sun were shining in our eyes. Our car was not working
        so we decided to take Mr. Sac’s car. “Sir, there was another murder last night right in our Colony. I have a feeling it’s the security who murdered Mr. Sac. We found this handkerchief lying next to Mr. Sac’s body. We thought it might help for
        some evidence” “What? Another murder? This is preposterous!” exclaimed the commissioner with surprise . He inspected the handkerchief with a lot of attention. Two murders and a robbery in one and a half days. Now the commissioner was pressurized
        and was really determined to go and catch the murderer. It was slowly becoming evident that one person has done all these three crimes because it has all happened in one area and in one and a half days. “Yes Sir” “Okay. I will keep that area on
        high alert for a few days so that if the murderer tries to commit another murder he will be caught” “Sir, I think we should check the C.C.T.V. cameras which are hung up next to Mr. Sac’s house. He is the only person in the entire community to
        have a C.C.T.V. camera in front of his house. The video tape will be available with the security” “Oh, I thought there are no C.C.TV. cameras in your Colony” “Yeah but there are two cameras in front of Sac’s house. He installed them for safety”
        “Okay let’s go and check then” “Sure Sir” As we approached the security, he got up. “Hello Sir. I am the police commissioner” “H- hello”, the security’s face started becoming red. “Can we see the footage of yesterday between evening three o’ clock
        and night nine o’ clock in the C.C.T.V. camera?” “O – okay Sir” As soon as the video started, the security sneezed. He used a yellow handkerchief with an ‘M’ printed on it to wipe his nose. “Hands up!”, the commissioner pointed his gun towards
        the security. “S – sir I didn’t do anything” “What is your name? Why did you murder Mr. Sac?” “Sir my name is Michael. I didn’t murder him. I don’t know anything about it.” “Show me your hands”, the commissioner hand cuffed him. We were now pretty
        sure that the murderer was the security because the ‘M’ print on the handkerchief, color of the handkerchief and the security’s name all were connected. “’M’ could stand for Michael?’, I thought as we took him to the police station. After a harsh
        interrogation, he accepted his crime and said that he was paid a huge amount of money for it. “Sir Mr. Fridge, a young man bribed me a few days back. He wanted my help for Mr. Sac’s and Mr. Jones’ murder. I told him all the information he needed
        for murdering Mr. Jones. He said that he wanted help in putting a poisonous plant next to his bed. I told him when and how he can put it and he did it. He paid me a huge amount of money and I helped him with the layout plan and the execution.
        I also switched off the C.C.T.V. cameras for him. He also gave me a lot of money for helping him with the robbery. I also helped him with the execution of that. As for Mr. Sac’s murder, I told him Mr. Sac’s daily lifestyle. At what time he is
        at home, at what time he comes out for a walk, etc. Yesterday night at seven fifty-five, he murdered Mr. Sac. He took me with him inside Sac’s house and gave me a knife. He went inside before me, murdered Mr. Sac and jumped out of the window.
        I thought it would be a wise idea to go out through the door to make it look normal. When I was just about to through the knife, Jignesh saw me and he thought that I murdered him” “Hmm. Any idea where Mr. Fridge will be?” “I am not sure Sir but
        I think he lives nearby because he used to come and meet me quite often” “Okay. Thanks for everything. We will keep you here for security purposes until we find Mr. Fridge” “Peter alert the police to look for a young man with a moustache called
        Mr. Fridge” “Sure Sir” The next day Mr. Fridge was found attempting a murder in Boulevard Stephen Colony. His description matched to that of the security’s. After another harsh interrogation, he accepted him committing the robbery and Mr. sac’s
        and Mr. Jones murder with a lot of embarrassment. When he was asked the reason for Mr. Jones’ murder he said, “Mr. Jones had borrowed money for buying a new car. He had promised to repay in one month after I gave him the money. Two months were
        over and I needed my money back. I still gave him a week and there was no response. Also, his son had consciously prevented my son from getting a seat in The Boulevard School, the best school of New York. His son used to frequently hurt my son.
        I warned him a couple of times but there was no positive response. So, I decided to murder Mr. Jones” When he was asked the reason for Mr. Sac’s murder he said, “Sir, I am a greedy man. I do anything for money. When I was going back after murdering
        Mr. Jones, I saw the luxurious house of Mr. Sac in the same Colony. It had lavish and ornate decorations. I went closer to get a better look. There were few people standing outside the door wanting to meet the person staying in the house, Mr.
        Lock. Just then, the security arrived and told them that Mr. Lock had gone for a vacation and he would return after ten days. I immediately got an idea of robbing the house. The next day, I went to the security and told him that if he would help
        me then I would give him ten percent of what I would find in the house and a few Dollars. He agreed and help me by switching of the C.C.T.V. and distracting anyone who passed from that area, etc. I thought after taking the security’s help no one
        would be able to catch me. When I came out after robbing the house, Mr. Sac, a neighbor to the person living in the house saw me. Since I didn’t want any clue and witnesses, I decided to murder him.” Shocked, the commissioner walked out of the
        room. The security guard was sent for a five-year imprisonment. Heron and James were released and there were new C.C.T.V. cameras fixed in front of almost every house in New York City. Mr. Fridge was seen standing behind the lavish black jail
        bars of New York City!!
