            “That’s a six and India wins by 7 wickets. Virat Kohli finishes of in style”, commented the sports anchor. I had always wanted to meet Virat as I wanted to ask him many things. It was like a dream! Although it had been three weeks since I sent him a letter,
            there had been no response. Ding Dong! “Savya, can you please open the door”, my mother called me. I walked towards the door wondering who it could be. On opening the door to a very well-known face, I was amazed! His shoulders were broad,
            his muscles were huge and he looked fit. It was Virat Kohli! A man in his mid-thirties, with a moustache and a beard was smiling at me. Dazed, I welcomed him inside and made him comfortable on my new white sofa. After having an astounding
            breakfast, he took me to his training nets for having an hour of practice. While walking towards the batting crease, I was shivering. The sports equipment was of extremely good quality. I was worried that I might break it. I realized that
            in the past one hour of training, I had learnt much more than what I had learnt in my six years of cricket coaching. I had learnt all the important techniques and skills. He gave me some general information about cricket and its history. At
            around 12, I took him to have some refreshing coconut water. “He is the captain of the Indian cricket team”, I told the coconut water seller, “his name is Virat Kohli”. “Really?”, he dropped the coconut which he was cutting in amazement and
            literally started to stare at Kohli. After five minutes, he calmed down and gave him the sweetest coconut water he had. “This is the best coconut water in the world”, Viral exclaimed. Instead of taking money, he took Virat Kohli’s autograph.
            We went by Metro to Cubbon Park. He was stunned to see all the beauty which he usually misses due to his busy schedule. We spent two hours there and then Virat took me to a restaurant where he usually goes with the Indian team. There were
            amazing carvings on the walls, big statues of elephants, large doors, lot of space and a pleasing ambience with light music. I had never seen such a place like this before. It was really grand and out of reach for me. We took lots of pictures,
            ate amazing food and then left for Forum mall. We spent the next 4 hours in Forum mall. I showed him everything and he bought me some nice clothes, a bat and a hanging ball for practicing. I thanked him a lot for it as it was a pleasure getting
            all these things from him. We reached home by metro and had high tea. Soon, it was time to say goodbye. I hugged him, took his autograph and went to the door to see him off. This was the best day of my life! When I returned to my room, reminiscing
            all the beautiful moments with Virat, I found a gift on my bed. Quickly unwrapping it, I was ecstatic to see a cricket bat with Virat’s autograph. There was a note which said, “Thank you Savya for a memorable day!!”
