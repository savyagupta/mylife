    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center; ">Cricket is the most popular sport in India. I like it because it helps players a lot. I feel that the players stay physically fit, they earn their living, they get fame and they are a source of inspiration for the young ones. Sometimes, players get
        a lot of fame and they can’t handle it. This increases their ego. They are forced to perform well all the time and if they don’t then they get pressurized and start comparing themselves with others in every way, not only in cricket. However, I
        feel that playing Cricket has a lot of benefits. It’s a team game so it helps you socialize with others and increase your love and respect for others. In addition, cricket also improves your concentrating skills. It helps you focus on one thing
        at a time. My feeling is that Cricket is a fun game. Everybody is involved all the time and is contributing equally. Cricket helps you build your team and leadership qualities as well as it’s a good recreational activity. Over the years, players
        have been impacted quite a lot with the growing popularity. Everybody wants to do better than others. Nobody plays for the team. For example, if in a match an inexperienced player has performed better than a very good and experienced player, then
        the ego of the experienced player is hurt. Instead of encouraging he just, for the sake of it, shakes hands and gives a fake smile. Nowadays, with growing competition, the sentiments of players as well as people are hurt. After every match, the
        players shake hands because they are forced to. It does not come out from their heart. They don’t appreciate each other’s performance. Also, after almost every match, if a player performs well then, he is like god. Everybody starts loving him
        and he becomes popular for that day. On the other hand, if a consistent player does not perform well in a match then he is deemed as a person who is not good at Cricket. Everybody is against him at that point. The next day, if he scores hundred
        then he is a god again. This happens mainly in India.
