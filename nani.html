    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center; ">As I moved my knight near the queen, the seventy-year-old petite woman sat back to reminisce the past seventy years of her life. The game of chess was getting intense. In the chilly winter morning, I wore a blue sweater which the lady’s wrinkled hands
        had knitted. On August second, 1951, a beautiful baby’s cries filled the air in Bulandshahr , Uttar Pradesh. The district was peaceful and had only independent houses. Till the age of six, she spent her time having fun and playing games like flying
        disk, stop-oo, skipping, etc. she was so good at skipping that it looked as if the rope and she were the best of friends. She joined the Government Girls Inter College in sixth standard and continued there till the twelfth grade. After school,
        every day, she used to help her mother make chapatis’, clean some things in the house, etc. there used to be no stove. There were primitive methods of cooking. She used to take coal, put mud around it, burn wood and light everything or buy “Angity”
        made of iron, put coal and light it. While the mother sat down on the earthen floor, which was as comfortable as the best sofa available right now, making hot chapatis’ (Indian bread), she and her siblings used to sit around with the aroma of
        the chapatis’ waiting for her to serve. “They used to taste better than what they do now!”, she always says. The girl was my grandmother. My grandmother did her DAV from degree college and passed BA. After completing her studies in 1972, she did
        sewing and embroidery diploma. She had great acumen in sewing and her techniques and finished works were impeccable. The stitched/knitted clothes was as good as or better than the machine made ones. She had got married to a man who was in the
        services who later on did his masters in technology. She still remembers the deafening sounds of the drums being played during her marriage. My grandmother continued her life as a house wife teaching her astounding kids and supporting her family
        through the thicks and thins. Now, although she is around seventy with wrinkled hands, grey and curly hair, she is still young in her heart. She moved her queen near my king on the chessboard. “Checkmate!”
