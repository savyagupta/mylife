    <hr>

    <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; text-align: center; ">Crack! The road had been divided into two. There was chaos. People didn’t know where to go as they saw buildings falling down. Small kids and women were running for their lives. There was a massive Earthquake. Hayley, a tall freckled scrawny girl,
        was trapped along with her friends, Peter and Cameron in the rubble. Her mother, Rose, was in the nearby school. Jill, Hayley’s father, was a pilot in the rescuer operation of New York City. Coincidently, Jill was in the helicopter during the
        Earthquake. “Where are you? The building is about to fall”, Rose called her husband on the phone. “Almost reached your building. Take as many people as you can to the roof. I am landing the helicopter on the helipad”, replied Jill as he saw that
        the building in which his wife was, was getting affected the most. “This building had been built many decades ago and hence might be the weakest among the other buildings”, thought Jill. Rose put in all efforts to guide people onto the roof but
        no one listened as they wanted to go down and get out of the building. She went up to the roof. Her hazelnut hair whipped in the wind as she scrambled into the helicopter. Shouting above the noise of the helicopter blades, Rose asked Jill if he
        had any news of their daughter. “I don’t know. Let’s hope she is fine. Let me call her”, replied Jill. “Hello Hayley”, said Rose relieved to hear her daughter’s voice. “Mom I am stuck. Please help me! Me, Cameron and Peter are hiding in the corner
        of two houses. Everything is falling and breaking. We are going to die. Please come fast” “Okay Hayley. Don’t worry we will come and get you by the helicopter. You remember are neighbor Daniel right? Just try and go to the roof of his building
        and we will get you” “Okay Mom. Please come fast” Hayley and her friends ran as fast as they could to Daniel’s building which was half a kilometer away. They knew that Daniel’s building could withstand such an Earthquake. At least Daniel had claimed
        that a while back. Soon Jill and Rose’s helicopter ran out of fuel and they had to land near the sea. As soon as they landed, to their horror, they realized that a big wave is going to crash onto the city. They quickly went to the sea, took a
        boat and tried to go over the tsunami wave. While they were on the wave, they thought about their daughter and the strength of Daniel’s building to withstand a tsunami. After crossing the wave, they waited for it to die down. Exhausted, the trio
        reached Daniel’s building. The sea water was quickly filling in. Jill and Rose, with their boat, came to the city in search of their daughter. They could not find Daniel’s building now as the whole city was completely destroyed and they could
        not make anything out. There were a couple of building which were safe so they rowed towards them through the remains of the lavish New York city. Suddenly, Rose saw a laser pointing at their boat. She turned back and saw Hayley. She was exhilarated!
        Immediately, they went toward the building. A new problem cropped up. While Hayley and the others were on the roof, the building’s exits were closed. Jill got an idea. He used the boat to break the building’s glass. Due to this, the bottom portion
        of the building broke and the roof came down. Now it was easy for them to jump into the water as the distance between them and the water was only about two feet. That was the only option Jill had as there was no other way Hayley and her friends
        could come down. If they jumped then probably, they would have died. Hayley, Cameron and Peter came out and swam to the awaiting boat. Jill and Rose pulled them in. A miraculous escape indeed! With tears in their eyes, they saw the remains of
        the big city of New York submerged in water.
