        Fumes of fire were blazing out of the skyscraper on the eve of Christmas in the New York City. It was eleven in the night and the top twenty floors were orange with the raging fire. The lush green garden and the helipad which were above the top floor
        had somehow escaped the fire. Gradually, the bottom thirty floors started catching fire. John’s family lived on the fiftieth floor. The skyscraper was a commercial cum residential building. It had sixty-five floors with high class facilities.
        There were only ten families staying there out of which nine were caught up in the ardent fire. Thirty-five-year-old brave, hefty, tall, ruffled cheeks John had two children, Jack and Sophie, of the ages twelve and eight respectively. His brave
        wife, Selina, was a courageous, short and clever woman of the age of thirty. They recently shifted to the under constructed skyscraper. John, who worked in Cisco, was living a happy life with his family. But things got too monotonous and he decided
        to take a break for two days. On the first day of the much-awaited break, the entire family was spending time together. That night while eating dinner, they heard a fire siren. John got up and sprang to the main door. Through the keyhole he could
        see the sizzling and devastating fire spreading through the corridor. He went back and took his family out of the house through the back door. They rushed out and realized that all the top floors had caught fire. They used the stairs to go down
        and reached the thirty first floor only to see that the searing fire had reached the thirtieth floor and was coming up. They went back and thought of their next move. The skyscraper didn’t have any arrangements of emergency exits by stairs as
        it was under construction. “Dad, let’s go down by the lift”, suggested jack. John had completely forgot about the lift which was an emergency exit in case of fire. The lift would go down or come up really fast so it would escape the fire. Selina
        quickly called 911 to summon a helicopter on the top of the skyscraper as her idea was to go up and not down. She thought that there would be fire on the ground floor and not on the floor of the helipad as that floor is fire proof. As they entered
        the lift, Sophie started sobbing. Her mom picked her up and John pressed the button which would take them directly to the helipad. In no time the could see the helipad and everyone except Sophie seemed happy. Her crying was reduced to short gasps.
        The New York police arrived with a helicopter and rescued the family. Back in their hotel room, John recalled their memorable and unforgettable experience. They would always remember the skyscraper especially the helicopter from which they were
        rescued and the lush green gardens in which Sophie had played a lot as a child. They soon bought an independent house and settled in comfortably.
