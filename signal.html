    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center; ">“Bye Leela”, I said as I entered my car and left for office. It was a smooth half an hour journey. I put my sunglasses on as the hot blistering sun was shining in my eyes. In New York the roads were nice and there was hardly any traffic. Suddenly,
        without realizing, I drove the car onto a crossing, which had no traffic signal. I had to stop. It was black all around me. My door did not open. There was a car behind me, a truck in front of me, and buses on my either side. I could not move.
        Everybody got out of their cars and started yelling at me. Not knowing what to do, I sat back in my seat and locked the door. I had an important client meeting to attend and I had left home on time. There was no time for any commotion. Not today!
        I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car. I tried to tell them to try and move their vehicles away as it would allow me to pass and clear the traffic jam. Angry shouts filled the air. The truck driver was showing his fist. After exchange
        of abuses, they agreed. It was a bit difficult for them as there were cars all around. However, that was the best thing that could have been done. I reached my office an hour late and missed my client meeting. I kicked the floor in anger. My mind
        went blank. I was furious and frustrated. I immediately wrote a vital letter to the Road Authority of New York city, talking about the preposterous management of signals and road traffic. I lost the deal with the client! These days, I thoroughly
        enjoy driving to office as the traffic management and the roads of New York have improved considerably.
