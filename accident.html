    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center; ">Ka Boom! The hazy air was filled with deafening screams and excruciating cries. Everyone fell down on the dirty blue floor. Painfully, I got up, helped a few and started walking towards the door which was tilted at an angle. The door gave a screeching
        sound but didn’t budge. Panic stricken, I felt helpless. The train had collided with another one! “Bye Mom”, I had said as I boarded the Rajdhani Express 122506. “Bye”, my mother had kissed me and I had gone to my seat. As the train started my
        mother’s eyes were filled with tears. The train slowly started catching speed and the ambience had become happier. While my best friend and I were playing cards, the train had suddenly stopped. After delay of three hours, the train had started
        to move and I had an inkling that something would go wrong. Just then the accident happened. Suddenly, I felt two hands pull me out of the broken window. After coming out, I looked for my best friend and found that he had succumbed to severe injuries.
        He had died! I burst into tears. I thought of all the good times we had had together. A week later, after things had settled down, I wrote a letter to the Railways Authority of India, highlighting the preposterous mismanagement of signals and
        tracks. I will never forget that dreadful day!
