    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center; "> Chess is a challenging indoor game played between two players. It involves a board, 16 pawns (8 white and 8 black), one King, one Queen, two Rooks, 2 Bishops and two Knights each side. Chess originated in India in the 6th Century AD and then spread
        to Southern Europe. The modern game began in the 19th Century. In chess, the Pawns can only move one step forward. For killing another piece, they can move one step diagonally. They can move two steps forward only in their first move. The Rooks
        can move vertically and horizontally any number of steps. While the Bishops can move diagonally only, the Knights can only move in an L-shape – One move to the right or left and then two to the front or back or one move to the right or left and
        then two to the front or back. Basically, it can move two and a half steps in all directions. The King can move in any direction anywhere but only to 1 step, except when it is castling. This tactic involves the King moving twice to the right or
        left and the Rook also moving on the same turn crossing the King. The most powerful piece is the Queen which can move anywhere and any number of steps. Chess is played in an extremely quiet indoor place as it involves a lot of focus and undivided
        attention. Magnus Carlsen and Viswanathan Anand are the two most well-known players of chess in India and outside. I liked chess because it increases my capability to think and it is interesting to strategize and win. Moreover, it works as a multi-tasking
        sporting activity as it helps me to focus more and pay attention to other activities. Chess has many benefits. Firstly, it improves your ability to think and strategize. Moreover, it gives you recognition and money. In addition, it improves your
        attention span. However, one disadvantage is that in the present world of fast-moving mobile games, a chess game takes way too long to finish, so people don’t prefer to play it.
